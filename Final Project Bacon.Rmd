### Creating Movies Database

library(TMDb)
library(dplyr)

api_key <- "17dccb4de2aa1a7bf742763a8dc633be"


movies <- discover_movie(
  api_key     = api_key,
  with_genres = 28,             
  primary_release_year = "2000"
)

movies_list <- movies$results

movies_df <- movies_list %>%
  select(id, title, release_date)

years <- as.character(2000:2024)

get_year_movies <- function(year_str) {

  first <- discover_movie(
    api_key = api_key,
    with_genres = 28,
    primary_release_year = year_str,
    page = 1
  )

  total_pages <- min(first$total_pages, 500)

  map_df(1:total_pages, ~ {
    Sys.sleep(0.25) 
    discover_movie(
      api_key = api_key,
      with_genres = 28,
      primary_release_year = year_str,
      page = .x
    )$results
  })
}

movies_all <- map_df(years, get_year_movies)

###                 

movies_df1 <- movies_all %>% 
  select(id, title, popularity, release_date)

movies_df1 <- movies_df1 %>%
  filter(
    release_date >= as.Date("2010-01-01"),
    release_date <= as.Date("2020-12-31")
    )
# Here we took movies_all and only selected movie id, movie title, movie popularity, and movie release date. We then filtered it to only include movies that were released from 2010 to 2020. We chose this because of the amount of the data that was pulled in from this package. With this time frame we had 11,370 movies to work with. 
  
```


```{r}
library(purrr)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)

safe_credits <- function(x) movie_credits(api_key, x)   #This is just using the api key we got.

credits_list <- map(movies_df1$id, safe_credits)      #This is the list of the movie credits

#This is making the edges of the actor and movie dataframe
actor_movie_edges <- map2_df(
  movies_df1$id,
  credits_list,
  ~ {
    if (is.null(.y)) return(NULL)
#This is making the cast list a tibble
    cast_df <- tibble::as_tibble(.y$cast)

    if (!"name" %in% names(cast_df)) return(NULL)
#This makes the dataframe with the actor id, actor name, and movie id 
    cast_df %>%
      select(actor_id = id, actor_name = name) %>%
      mutate(movie_id = .x)
  }
)

## Section Two
```{r}

write.csv(movies_df1, "movie", row.names = FALSE) # This is writing the data frame that was pulled from the package to a csv for easy access for everyone in the group.

movies <- read.csv("movie")  

movies
```


```{r}
write.csv(actor_movie_edges, "actor1", row.names = FALSE)

actor <- read.csv("actor1") %>% # Here we renamed the column to match with the data frame movies to allow for a join based on id.
  rename(id = movie_id)

actor

```

```{r}

movies <- movies %>% # This ensures that there are no duplicates and keeps only one row per movie. 
  distinct(id, .keep_all = TRUE)


actor_movies <- actor %>% # Here we did a left join to join the movies data set onto the actor data set based on the movie id. R prompted us to set the relationship to "many-to-many". 
  left_join(movies, by = "id", relationship = "many-to-many")


```



```{r}

actor_graph <- graph_from_data_frame(actor_movies[, c("actor_name", "id")], directed = FALSE)
#This is creating the graph from the dataframe.

```

```{r}
connect_to_mark <- function(actor) {
  p <- shortest_paths(actor_graph, actor, "Mark Wahlberg")$vpath[[1]]               #This is finding the shortest path from an input actor and connecting it back to Mark Wahlberg
  if (length(p) == 0) return("No connection found.")    #This is saying if there is no path to Mark Wahlberg then it will give an output saying "No connection found."

  nodes <- names(p)
#This replaces the movie id with the movie names
  path <- sapply(nodes, function(x)
    if (x %in% actor_movies$id) actor_movies$title[actor_movies$id == x][1] else x
  )
#This adds how many movies it took to connect back to Mark Wahlberg
  movie_count <- sum(path %in% actor_movies$title)
#This prints the path including actors and how many movies it took
  list(
    path = unname(path),
    movies = movie_count
  )
}


```

```{r}
#This is testing the function
connect_to_mark("Jason Momoa")
